1. JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted language. Interpreted languages differ from compiled languages due to the fact that the source code is not directly translated by the target machine, which would make the source code completely indecipherable to humans. Instead the interpreter reads and executes the code. 
2. Dynamically typed languages are able to change their type during runtime, while static typed languages have set types for their variables, which means that their typing cannot be changed. Strongly typed languages such as JavaScript can have its variables change types during runtime, while weakly typed languages such as C++ have set data types such as int and string, so its variables cannot change during runtime.
3. Var is global scoped, meaning it can be used anywhere in the code, and it's redeclareable, meaning that redeclaring it will not make it lose its value. Let is block scoped, so it can only be used within its block of code, and it's also redeclarable. Const is both block scoped and non declarable.
4. An anonymous function is a function that is nameless. A higher-order function is a function that either returns a function or uses other functions in its arguments. A callback function is a function used as an argument in a higher-order function. A first class function is a function that is treated like a variable.
5. In JavaScript, an object is a data structure that consists of key value pairs.
