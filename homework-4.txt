1. DOM stands for Document Object Model, and it specifies how browsers should create a model an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. It is the browserâ€™s live rendering/representation of the html page. The model that is created by DOM is called a DOM tree. It's stored in the browsers' memory and has four main types of nodes, the document node, the element nodes, the attribute nodes, and the text nodes.
2. An XSS attack, also known as a Cross-Site Scripting Attack, is when a malicious user puts malicious code into a user input on a website with the purpose of it being ran for other users. Programmers can guard against it by fixing their HTML code by making inputs from users shown as sparingly as possible. If that input must be put into the code itself, then there could also be a filter put into the user input that always removes tags from the inputs and the like.
3. An event is something that happens to HTML elements. A button element could have the event "click" in order for the code to apply when the button is clicked.
4. An event listener handles events, and is the only one that can deal with more than one function at a time. It sets up functions to be called whenever the event occurs to its target. It expects two parameters: the event it will respond to and the function that it will run when the event is called.
5. jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library that make common tasks in code that tend to take many lines of code and makes it one single line of code instead. It is used so that web developers can have an easier time setting up JavaScript code, as it's a very good timesaver. jQuery can be implemented by adding "<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js"></script>" to any <head> element in an HTML file.
