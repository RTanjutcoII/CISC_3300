1. A class is a template for creating objects, and an object is an instance of a class. OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is used to describe languages that use objects to design programs.
2. We use abstract classes when the main class provides some high level functionality, but the specifics are to be done by its derived classes.
3. Superglobals are predefined variables in PHP. For example, the $_SERVER superglobal will take data from the server itself no matter where it is.
4. The first step is to define a namespace in the class to be used. The second step is to put it in the place we want to use the class in, whether through importing the namespace (preferred) or typing out the full namespace every time the class must be used.
5. MVC (Model, View, and Controller) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: Model, View, and Controller, as the name implies. The model component is for all the data-related logic that the user works with. The controller component is the component that acts as a middleman between the view and the model. It merely tells the model what to do, not handling data logic. The view component is for the UI of the application or website.
