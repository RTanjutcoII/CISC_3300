1. PDOs are a built in class. It comes packaged with PHP and it makes it easy to interact with databases. They represent and manage the connection to the database. This is also how PHP takes SQL as an input and returns the results from the database and stores it in a variable. DSNs are how we instantiate PDO objects. They represent the connection to the database. It contains information about our connection.
2. A .env file is a file with environment variables. These environment variables are variables which have values that are set outside the program. This is usually done through a functionality that's built into the operating system. A gitignore file is a text file that has the files and folders that we want Git to ignore. For example, we don't want Git to copy our .env file.
3. Absolutely not, as doing so breaches security.
4. An SQL injection is a type of hack where a hacker tries to run malicious SQL code in a database.
5. A prepared statement is a parametrized and reusable SQL query which makes the developer write the SQL command and the user-provided data separately. This prevents SQL injections. We can pass variables to a prepared statement by calling the execute method, which passes it an associative array.
