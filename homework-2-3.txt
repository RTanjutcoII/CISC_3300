Flexbox and CSS Grid, while having similar functionalities, have a key difference. Flexbox only has one dimension, while CSS Grid has two dimensions. While this may make Flexbox seem inferior, Flexbox is much better for simpler websites, while CSS Grid is for websites that are more complex. For example, there is no need to designate start and end lines for each box, while such a need exists for CSS Grid.
