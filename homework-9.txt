1. SQL means Structured Query Language. It is a standard language used for database creation and manipulation. MySQL is a relational database system that uses SQL queries. Relational databases use a structure that allows one to identify and access data related to another piece of data in the database. These are known as relationships.
2. Normalization is the avoidance of duplication by using relationships. It organizes the columns and tables of a database to ensure that database integrity constraints properly execute their dependencies.
3. Primary keys are the fields that are used to uniquely identify each record in a table. Foreign keys are fields that reference the primary key in another table.
4. The three relationship types are one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.
5. A left join returns all the records from the left table, and the matching records from the right table. Meanwhile, inner join selects records that have matching values for both tables.

a. CREATE DATABASE `homework_9`;
b. CREATE TABLE `library`
   (
      `id`   integer(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      `name` varchar(80) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      primary key (`id`)
   );
c. CREATE TABLE `books`
   (
      `id`   integer(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      `name` varchar(80) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      primary key (`id`)
   );
d. CREATE TABLE `libraryBook`
   (

      `libraryID` varchar(80) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      `bookID`    integer(11) NOT NULL,
      primary key (`id`)
   );

a. insert into library (id, name)
   values (1, `New York Public Library`);
   insert into library (id, name)
   values (2, `53rd Street Library`);
   insert into books (id, name)
   values (1, `1984`);
   insert into books (id, name)
   values (2, `James and the Giant Peach`);
b. insert into libraryBook (libraryID, bookID)
   values (1, 1);
   insert into libraryBook (libraryID, bookID)
   values (2, 2);
c. SELECT * FROM library WHERE id = 1;
d. SELECT * FROM books WHERE name LIKE `%Giant%`;
e. SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY name ASC;
8. SELECT * FROM books JOIN libraryBook ON books.id = libraryBook.bookID;
9. UPDATE books SET name = `Animal Farm` WHERE id = 1;
10. DELETE books where id = 1;
